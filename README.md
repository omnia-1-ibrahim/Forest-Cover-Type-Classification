# Forest Cover Type Classification

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the type of forest cover based on various cartographic variables.  
The dataset contains measurements such as elevation, aspect, slope, soil type, and wilderness area, and the target variable is the forest cover type (categorical).

This type of classification task is useful in ecological studies, forest management, and environmental monitoring.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Source:** Forest Cover Type Prediction Dataset (UCI / Kaggle)
- **Format:** CSV file (e.g., `forest_cover.csv`)
- **Features Include:**
  - Elevation
  - Aspect
  - Slope
  - Horizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology
  - Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology
  - Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways
  - Hillshade at different times of day
  - Wilderness_Area (binary indicators)
  - Soil_Type (categorical indicators)
- **Target Variable:**
  - Cover_Type (1 to 7)

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas â€“ Data manipulation
- NumPy â€“ Numerical computations
- Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ Data visualization
- Scikit-learn â€“ Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression)

## ðŸš€ Steps in the Project
1. Import Libraries
2. Load Dataset
3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
   - Handle missing values (if any)  
   - Feature scaling  
   - Encode categorical variables
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Model Training (e.g., Random Forest Classifier)
6. Model Evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)
7. Model Saving (optional for deployment)

## ðŸ“Š Expected Output
- Trained classification model capable of predicting the forest cover type.
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
- Visualizations of feature importance and distribution.
